## Getting Started

NES Development inspired by [NES Doug](https://nesdoug.com) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE.

Primary development on a Windows 10 machine with Cygwin, but instructions should apply to other systems supported by the [cc65 compiler](http://cc65.github.io/cc65/).

### Prerequisites

* [cygwin with make (part of the development package)](https://www.cygwin.com/)
* Add the cygwin bin subdirectory to your path


NES tools (add to your nes-cc65 home directory to avoid makefile changes)

* [cc65](http://cc65.github.io/cc65/) 
* [fceux emulator](http://www.fceux.com/web/home.html)
* [yychr](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/)

Directory structure should look like:

```
/nes-cc65
    /cc65
    /dev
    /fceux
    /yychr
```
